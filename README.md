# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an entrepreneur & software engineer based in ~~Atlanta~~ Kansas City. Currently, I'm building [Hopeware](https://hopeware.com) to help organizations increase their technology effectiveness. Before that, I led technology at [New Story](https://newstoryhomes.org), a housing non-profit best known for building the world's first [3D-printed Community](https://l.timw.co/3dfirst). Apple even filmed a [documentary](https://tv.apple.com/us/episode/mexico/umc.cmc.vw8qwc1j4ld8jr3itsc0b3wy) about us. I think you should check it out.

Outside of that, I run [Sunset Labs](https://sunsetlabs.io), where I invest in and help startups at various stages.

In a past life, I helped launch and taught at [The Iron Yard](https://linkedin.com/school/the-iron-yard/), the (at the time) largest code school in the world. I also helped build a WordPress competitor, [Barley](https://l.timw.co/2BEcXXg), that sadly fizzled away into nothingness alongside Google Wave.
